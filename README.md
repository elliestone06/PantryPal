Whether you're scanning items, organizing your pantry, or generating recipes based on your available ingredients, PantryPal streamlines the way users manage their food.

## 💡 Core Features

### 🧾 Account System
Users can register accounts using their email, enabled through Python's SQLAlchemy. Each account provides personalized inventory tracking.

### 🍎 Item Entry
Users can manually add items or scan barcodes to auto-fill information using the Open Food Facts API. Users provide the quantity and expiration date; everything else is fetched for them.

### 📦 Inventory + Grocery List
Items are organized by category and expiration date. A separate grocery list allows users to track items they plan to purchase.

### 🍳 Recipe Generation
With a single click, PantryPal generates a unique recipe based on what's in your pantry — including the recipe name, required ingredients, quantities, and preparation steps.
